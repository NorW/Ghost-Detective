		d $o Death $n ??? $t Hey Bub, I've got bad news for you. You died, and I know that because I am Death.
			d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t Huh… that's unfortunate. How did it happen?
				d $o Death $t How would I know? [Shrugs] You were alive and then you weren't. That's it.
					d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t I see… so someone was at fault here. I must find them!
						d $o Death $t What? Ugh… humans are so dramatic, even in the after life.
							d $o Death $t Here, it sounds to me like you’re about to do something stupid. So, take this and call me when you're done.
								d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t Ok, captain. I accept this badge and will honor it until I find the one responsible for my demise.
									d $o Death $t I…, I am no captain, and that is not a badge. It's a magical rock named ‘Dwayne’ for you to summon me when you're done. 
										d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t I'm sure I'll get to the bottom of this mystery because I am… GHOST DETECTIVE!
											d $o Death $t Oh my Gods…. Whatever, see you later.
												d $o Ghost Detective $t And so my journey begins…
