			d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $v GD-Huh.mp3 $t Huh… that's unfortunate. How did it happen? Who are you?
				d $o Death $t Me, I’m DEATH. How you died? How would I know? [Shrugs] You were alive and then you weren't. That's it.
					d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t I see… so someone… someone clearly murdered me. I must find them!
						d $o Death $v Death_Get_on_with-jt.mp3 $t What? Ugh… humans are so dramatic, even in the after life.

								d $o Death $v Death_Get_on_with-jt.mp3 $t Here, it sounds to me like you’re about to do something stupid. So, take this and call me when you're done.
									d $o Ghost Detective $n ??? $t Ok, captain. I accept this badge and will honor it until I find the one responsible for my demise.
										d $o Death $t I uh-?? I am no captain, and that is not a badge. It's a magical rock named ‘Dwayne’ for you to summon me when you're done.
											d $o Ghost Detective $v VO-03.mp3 $t I'm sure I'll get to the bottom of this mystery because I am… GHOST DETECTIVE!
